Once a songÂ has been played, it will appear on the bottom of the screen in the "playbar." The track will continue to play while visitors navigate throughout the site, and the play status, as indicated by the play button, will be kept as users move to different pages.

Users can also mute / modify the volume, resume the track, and toggle looping. Users can skip around on the current track by clicking on the seek bar.
